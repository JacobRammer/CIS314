In total there are 1024 iterations in the loop (32^2).
In total, there are 4096 operations within the loop

a)
I know the miss rate will be worse than b because we're iterating through columns.
Since we're iterating through the columns, it will be a miss every time


b)
So, I believe on the first iteration, it will be a cold miss (obviously), and we're
iterating through the rows, and we can fit 2 colorpoints in the cache (cache = 62b, struct = 32b)
so 32 * 16 = 512,  512/4096 = 12.5%
